The logfloat library provides a type for storing numbers in the log-domain. This is primarily useful for avoiding underflow when multiplying many small numbers in probabilistic models.

It also includes support for dealing with IEEE-754 floating point numbers (more) correctly, including: a class for types with representations for transfinite values, a class for partially ordered types, efficient and correct conversion from \texttt{Real} to \texttt{Fractional}, and bug fixes for Hugs' Prelude.

\FuturePlans
Add a signed variant so negative numbers can also be projected into the log-domain.
