* Add a strict variant
  - Make it default and move the current to Data.Number.LogFloat.Lazy
  - Make sure it unpacks into registers
* Add a signed variant
* Add some unit tests for regression checking
  - but beware of the fuzz
  - Make sure to test transfinite values everywhere in Hugs
* Profile or look at Core to make sure we do not waste too much time constructing dictionaries. If so, reconsider the four smart constructors/destructors.

* Make sure rewrite rules really fire
