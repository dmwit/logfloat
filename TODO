* Switch to using "<math.h> log1p" via FFI
  - Figure out how to tell Cabal to tell hugs to run ffihugs

* Add a strict variant. Actually, I think the current version is as strict as it can be thanks to newtype data-constructors being strict. Should verify this (how?) and make sure things unpack into registers (how?)

* Add a signed variant

* Add some unit tests for regression checking
  - but beware of the fuzz
  - Make sure to test transfinite values everywhere in Hugs

* Profile or look at Core to make sure we do not waste too much time constructing dictionaries. If so, reconsider the four smart constructors/destructors.

* Make sure rewrite rules really fire
