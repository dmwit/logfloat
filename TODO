== Portability ==
* Cabal+Hugs
  - how to tell to run ffihugs?
  - how to do the right thing re __HUGS__, cpphs,...?
* Foreign.Storable instance for Hugs
* IArray UArray LogFloat instances for nhc98/yhc, jhc/lhc


== Functionality ==
* Add a signed variant


== Debugging ==
* Investigate bug about the (>=) in Hugs, re NaN and the Num LogFloat instance.

* Add some unit tests for regression checking
  - but beware of the fuzz
  - Make sure to test transfinite values everywhere in Hugs!

* Verify that the current instance is entirely strict
  - verify that things unpack into registers (how?)

* Profile or look at Core to make sure we do not waste too much time constructing dictionaries. If so, reconsider the four smart constructors/destructors.

* Make sure rewrite rules really fire
