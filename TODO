== Portability ==
* Cabal+Hugs: how to do the right thing re __HUGS__, cpphs,...?
* Foreign.Storable instance for Hugs (and nhc98/yhc, jhc/lhc)
* IArray UArray LogFloat instances for nhc98/yhc, jhc/lhc

* BUG ghc6.10: Cannot mix -fvia-C with the FFI.
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3117>
  * Switch to -fasm ?
    * establish benchmarks

* Ask Windows users about ccall vs stdcall issues?


== Functionality ==
* Add a signed variant
* Add "safe" FFI version for multithreaded users?
  * Find out if it actually affects performance.


== Debugging ==
* Investigate bug about the (>=) in Hugs, re NaN and the Num LogFloat instance.

* Add some unit tests for regression checking
  - but beware of the fuzz
  - Make sure to test transfinite values everywhere in Hugs!

* Verify that the current instance is entirely strict
  - verify that things unpack into registers (how?)

* Profile or look at Core to make sure we do not waste too much time constructing dictionaries. If so, reconsider the four smart constructors/destructors.

* Make sure rewrite rules really fire
